# Enrolled Students

Use this to manually assign or remove students who will be able to take this module. Assigning or removing students on a module will also affect their access on the units under it. Basic information such as their name, email, timezone, and if they are currently an active user will be available on the table.

You may unenroll students using the Unenroll button. Once unenrolled, they won't be able to access the module and the units for that module.

# Enrolled Teachers

Same as the section above, but for teachers

# Included Units

Modules will have units and they will be shown here. Only unique units are allowed on a module.
