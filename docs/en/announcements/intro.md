Announcements is a feature to notify your users of events within the ESL system. You may use this to broadcast important things that you want your users to know. To find the admin panel for announcements, look for **Announcements** on the top navigation of your screen. If you're on mobile, you need to expand the hamburger menu on your left to find the Announcements link.

# Creating/Editing announcements

The system will automatically determine the <ins>[slug](/admin/help/miscellaneous/terminologies#)</ins> of announcements based on the <ins>[Title](#fields)</ins> field when created/edited.

- **Title**: Name of the announcement.
  - Max length: 128 characters
  - Min length: 5 characters
  - Required

- **Description**: A brief background on what the students can expect from this announcement. Markdown formatting is supported.
  - Min length: 5 characters
  - Required

- **Tags**: A <ins>[tag](/admin/help/miscellaneous/terminologies#)</ins> makes it easier to find content. All tags will be transmuted to lowercase. To add the tag, press the Enter, Tab, or comma (,) keys.
  - Max length: 32 characters
  - Min length: 2 characters

When editing an announcement, you'll see 3 additional uneditable fields - Author, Announced on, and Updated on.
