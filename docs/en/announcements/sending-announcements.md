# Introduction

> ℹ️ Recipients only get notified once. Editing an announcement and sending it won't have any effect if the recipients have already received the announcement beforehand

Once you are done creating your announcement, you may send them to your intended recipients. Right now, you can only send them by user role. The following user roles are listed below:

1. Admin
2. Head Teacher
3. Student
4. Teacher

The system will send this in batches, with 200 users per batch. Assuming you have 300 users for the students and teacher roles combined, they will be sent in 2 batches - the first 200 users will receive it first then followed by the last 100 users.

When you send the announcements, your recipients will only be notified once.
