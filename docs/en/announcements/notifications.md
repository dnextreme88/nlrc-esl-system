# Introduction

A key feature on being able to get the latest updates on the ESL system is how the users are notified of the announcements sent by the system. Users can only receive the announcements once a staff member sends it on the admin panel and they are part of the user roles they selected. To view the announcements, you may find it by clicking your picture on the upper right of the screen then selecting Announcements.

# Announcements Page

Your users have the ability to see all the announcements that they are a recipient in. The main Announcements will list all of them and they will see a couple of details related to it such as who made the announcement, when the announcement was made, and if ever, when the announcement was updated. A red, pulsating circle means they haven't read the announcement whereas anything without means they have read it. If the announcement is longer than 200 characters, recipients will see a Read More text and the announcement will be <ins>[truncate](/admin/help/miscellaneous/terminologies#)</ins> to fit the 200-character limit.

They will also see <ins>[tags](/admin/help/miscellaneous/terminologies#)</ins> in green, round text that you have defined for the announcement. However, this is only used for "categorizing" the announcement and currently no feature (such as filtering them by tag) exist yet.

For them to "read" the announcement, they must click the announcement and they will be taken into a page so they can read the announcement in full.

# Notification Bell

A big part of user interaction is the ability for your users to receive site-wide notifications regarding the system. Users may access their notifications easily by clicking the bell icon near their picture on the upper right side of the screen. The number found on the icon is the number of unread notificaitons they have, so anything greater than 0 means they are yet to open an announcement you have sent. When users are notified about the announcement you have sent, they will automatically receive it and will update the count accordingly.

Like the previous section, they will see a red, pulsating circle if they haven't read the announcement. If they click the announcement, the system marks it as "read" and they will be taken into a page so they can read the announcement in full.

Notifications inside this bell can only show the 5 latest notifications, including announcements. They must click "See more notifications" to view older notifications.
