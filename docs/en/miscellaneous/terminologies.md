# Slug

A slug is a URL-friendly part of a web address that uniquely identifies a specific page, post, category, or tag. It appears after the domain name in the URL, helping both users and search engines understand what the content is about.

# Tag

A tag is a simple word, phrase, or keyword used to categorize and organize content. Tags are often helpful in searching for specific content and making it easier to find what you're looking for. Similar to categories, tags are more specific to the content it represents. This is currently used for announcements and with the exception of the admin panel, is only for viewing purposes. A feature to search for announcements outside of the admin panel based on tags can be implemented in the near future.

# Truncate

Truncate is to cut off or shorten part of the text to meet its desired purpose. Truncation of text is usually used when we need to shorten content if they don't fit a certain criteria. For example, truncation of text happens on the notification bell if an announcement's description is longer than 32 characters because we want to make it readable for the user and at the same time, try to fit the content on a small space for a notification.

Truncation also happens on the main Announcements page, if the announcement's description is longer than 200 characters, simply because can fit more space but at the same time, save up some space so we can display as much content as possible.
