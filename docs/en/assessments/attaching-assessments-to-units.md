# Introduction

> ℹ️ If you don't see your assessment on the dropdown, you must make it active and add at least 1 question

Once you are done creating your assessments, you may attach them to units so that the students can take the assessments you have created. To find the admin panel for units

1. Go to **Modules** on the top navigation of your screen. Click on **Units** found on the left. If you're on mobile, you need to expand the hamburger menu on your left to find the Units link.
2. Select a unit you want to attach the assessment to. You may also filter or use the search box to search for the name of the assessment.
3. Under the form, go to **Assessments**. Click the **Add new assessment** button.
4. On the modal that shows up, select the assessment that you want to attach to your current unit.
