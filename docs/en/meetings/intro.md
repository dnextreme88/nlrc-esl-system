# Introduction

Conducting one-to-many or one-to-one sessions are a great way for teachers and students to communicate to each other. Teachers may highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a student, ask help, get feedback, or assist them in general with regards to their ESL journey. Meetings are also an effective way for teachers to build rapport with their students so they can confidently finish the entire course and use what they have learned for their endeavors. To find the admin panel for meetings, look for **Meetings** on the top navigation of your screen. If you're on mobile, you need to expand the hamburger menu on your left to find the Meetings link. Afterwards, select Meetings from the left side of the panel.

Currently, you can only view the meetings that have been created on the website. There is no create/edit functionality.
